picobgp is minimalistic not-compliant-bgp free-inspired daemon for
subnetwork advertising and route topology update.

The picobgp software was written to dynamically update the routing
tables of some PCs of my vpns and so it doesn't want to became
a solution for a generic problem but I hope that this code can be useful
to someone else!

USAGE
---------------
Advertising a couple of subnet, external interface eth0, this will
also receive advertising from vpn0 iface:
   picobgp -i vpn0 -s 10.0.1.0/24 -s 78.9.2.0/24

Receive the routing advertising end populate the route table
automatically:
   picobgp -i eth0
